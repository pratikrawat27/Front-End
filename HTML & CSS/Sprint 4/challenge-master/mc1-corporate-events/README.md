## Tasks
- The solution for this challenge can be developed in 4 stages:​
    - Stage 1 :: Header with a nav bar​
    - Stage 2 :: Single column Hero Unit which occupies full width ​
    - Stage 3 :: Main section with three columns​
    - Stage 4 :: Footer with social media links​
- The HTML code for the page design is provided in the index.html file.​
- The style properties should be defined in style.css located in the css folder of the boilerplate.​
- Use the flex layout for the header and main sections.​
- Use the grid layout for the footer.

### Using Flex and Grid Layout - Recommendations

- The layout for the header should be styled using the flex property.​
- All the menu items inside the fixed header must be links.​
- The hero unit should extend the entire width of the page and must have a background image, a header section with text content and a button.​
- The main section should have 3 cards that contain an image and text. Use flex layout to create this section.​
- The footer should use the grid layout which has a single row and 5 columns.​
- Use media queries to make the header, hero unit, main section and footer responsive.​
